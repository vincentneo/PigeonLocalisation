  Pigeon v1.3

  Created by Vincent Neo, last updated on 6 December 2023.
 
  Replace the Created by name, if you would like to be credited in the app.
  
  %@ typically refers to an external value, but may also refer to an icon in certain cases.
  "KEY" = "VALUE"; VALUE is what that will be displayed in the app.
 
  Keys prefixed with 'VO' are definitely for VoiceOver readouts.
